#### How to get Started?

Install the backend dependencies on root folder using `npm install` command.

Set your own credentials for cloudinary and mongodb database on the root folder inside a .env file like below-

Create a .env file in the root and add the following-

```bash
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI="Your mongo uri"
JWT_SECRET="Anything you like"
CLOUD_NAME="Your cloudindary name"
API_KEY="Your cloudinary api key"
API_SECRET="Your cloudinary api secret"
SEND_GRID_API="Your send grid free api"
USER1="The email sender which you have used in sendgrid"
```

Move to frontend folder and install frontend dependencies using `npm install` command.

And there you go...boom!
